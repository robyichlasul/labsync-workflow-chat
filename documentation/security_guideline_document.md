# Security Guidelines for `labsync-workflow-chat`

This document outlines the security principles, best practices, and concrete recommendations for building and maintaining the **Labsync Chat Workflow** application. It covers every layer—from authentication to infrastructure—to ensure a secure, resilient, and trustworthy system by design.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

1.1. Secure Integration with Clerk
- Leverage Clerk’s managed authentication flows for sign-in, sign-up, password resets, and session management.  
- Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, rotation).  
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for roles with elevated privileges (e.g., owners, managers).

1.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define discrete roles: **owner**, **manager**, **staff**.  
- Enforce role checks on every page and API route server-side using Next.js middleware and Clerk JWT claims.  
- Integrate Clerk’s role metadata with Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict database reads/writes at the row and bucket level.

1.3. Session & Token Security
- Use Clerk’s rotating, cryptographically secure session tokens.  
- Set session idle and absolute timeouts.  
- Protect against session fixation by regenerating session IDs upon privilege elevation (e.g., MFA enrollment).
- For any custom JWTs, validate `alg`, verify signatures, and check required claims (`sub`, `exp`, `iat`).

## 2. Input Handling & Processing

2.1. Parameterized Queries & ORM Safety
- Use **Drizzle ORM** with parameterized queries to interact with Supabase.  
- Never build SQL queries via string interpolation.

2.2. Server-Side Validation
- Mirror all client-side validations on the server.  
- Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod) for chat messages, status posts, file metadata, and API payloads.

2.3. Preventing Injection Attacks
- Sanitize user-supplied text (chat, statuses) to strip or encode any HTML/JS.  
- Use context-aware encoding when displaying user content in React components (e.g., `{React.escapeHTML(...)}`).

2.4. File Upload Hardening
- Enforce strict MIME type and extension allow-lists (e.g., `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.jpg`, `.png`).  
- Validate file size limits both client-side and server-side.  
- Store files in Supabase Storage buckets outside the public webroot.  
- Scan all uploads for malware if possible (e.g., integrate a virus scanning service).
- Prevent path traversal by normalizing and sanitizing filenames before storage.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

3.1. Encryption
- Enforce **TLS 1.2+** for all client–server and server–server communications (Vercel automatically provides HTTPS).  
- Supabase data is encrypted at rest by default; confirm encryption for any self-hosted backups.

3.2. Secrets Management
- Store API keys (Clerk, Supabase, OpenAI) and database URLs in **Vercel Environment Variables** or a dedicated secrets manager.  
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in source code or client bundles.

3.3. Minimizing Data Exposure
- Return only the minimum required fields in every API response.  
- Mask or truncate PII (e.g., email, phone) when not strictly needed.

3.4. Logging & Error Handling
- Log errors at the application level without exposing stack traces or sensitive request data to clients.  
- Centralize and monitor logs (e.g., using a log aggregation service) and redact sensitive fields.

## 4. API & Service Security

4.1. Enforce HTTPS & CORS
- All endpoints must require HTTPS.  
- Configure Next.js `headers()` to include HSTS.  
- Restrict CORS to the application’s own origin (or whitelisted domains) in `next.config.js`.

4.2. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
- Implement rate limiting on critical API routes (e.g., chat message creation, status posts) using Vercel Middleware or a third-party service.  
- Introduce exponential back-off and CAPTCHA on repeated failed authentication or abuse patterns.

4.3. Versioned API Design
- Prefix all API routes with `/api/v1/` and plan for backward-compatible versioning for future changes.

4.4. Principle of Least Privilege for Service Accounts
- Issue service keys with scoped permissions for Supabase real-time listeners, storage uploads, and database operations.  
- Rotate service keys regularly and revoke unused or compromised keys promptly.

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

5.1. CSRF Protection
- Use anti-CSRF tokens (NextAuth or custom implementation) for all state-changing POST/PUT/DELETE requests.  
- Store tokens in `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookies and validate them in API routes.

5.2. Security Headers
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Restrict scripts, styles, and frame sources.  
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`.  
- X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`.  
- X-Frame-Options: `DENY`.  
- Referrer-Policy: `no-referrer-when-downgrade` or stricter.

5.3. Secure Cookies
- Set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` for all session and CSRF cookies.

5.4. Subresource Integrity (SRI)
- For any third-party CDN scripts or styles, include integrity hashes in `<script>` and `<link>` tags.

## 6. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

6.1. Vercel Production Hardening
- Disable Next.js debugging features and verbose error overlays in production.  
- Use separate environment variables for development, staging, and production.

6.2. Supabase RLS & Storage Policies
- Enable RLS on all tables: enforce row-level checks based on `auth.uid()` and user roles.  
- Define storage bucket policies to permit uploads/downloads only to authorized users/conversations.

6.3. Operating Environment
- For local Docker-based Postgres development, bind to `localhost` only and use non-default credentials.  
- Keep all dependencies (OS, containers, libraries) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

6.4. File System Permissions
- On any self-hosted components, grant minimal file system permissions: application user should own code directories and logs only.

---

## 7. Dependency Management

- Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`) to pin dependency versions.  
- Integrate automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to monitor for new CVEs.  
- Periodically audit transitive dependencies and remove unused packages to minimize attack surface.

---

## 8. DevOps & CI/CD Security

- Sign and verify commits and Docker images (if used) to guarantee integrity.  
- Use Vercel’s Protected Environment feature to require approvals for production deployments.  
- Run automated linting, type checks, and security scans in every CI pipeline.

## Conclusion
By embedding these security controls across the authentication layer, API surface, data storage, and deployment pipeline, the Labsync Chat Workflow application will adhere to **security by design**, **least privilege**, and **defense in depth**. Regular reviews, audits, and updates will ensure that the system remains robust against evolving threats.

For any deviations or uncertainties, flag the design for an architectural security review before implementation.
